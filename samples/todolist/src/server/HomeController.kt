   * logged in, or the regular app page & container if they are.
   *
   * The content for this page depends conditionally on the user's login status. If they aren't logged in, we render a
   * page with a sign-in button and a little toy copy of Todolist. The toy copy is identical to the real one, but it
   * offers no persistence of tasks beyond the current browser session.
   *
   * If the user opts to make use of the anonymous/toy version, and then later chooses to sign in, their previous tasks
   * are preserved, along with their user ID (using anonymous user upgrade via Firebase). This flow happens via the
   * client-side app, so we don't need to worry about it here. Similarly, if the user hits the homepage without being
   * logged in, and then logs in, that flow is also handled by the re-hydrated CSR frontend.
